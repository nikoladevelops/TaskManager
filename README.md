# TaskManager
This is a simple todo web app I made that supports login/register.

# Features
- Register/Login
- Add a task
- Delete a task
- Edit a task

# How do I run this?
- Install all dependencies using <b>npm install</b>
- Create a <b>.env</b> file and paste this:

PORT=ThePortNumberGoesHere <br>
SESSION_SECRET=YourSessionSecretGoesHere <br>
MONGO_URI=YourMongoURIGoesHere

Fill in your own data and you are done.
